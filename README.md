# Connect Four App

This is a work-in-progress solution to the [Connect Four game](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/connect-four-game-6G8QVH923s) challenge on FrontendMentor.io - a hosted Blazor WebAssembly app.


## Features

> Make your application a **CRUD API**

A **CRUD API** using the Entity Framework Core inluding a [form](https://ajhughesdev.github.io/ConnectFourApp/player) whose input values of initials and score are saved to a localhost database and can be edited and deleted

> Make your application **asynchronous**

**Asychronous** when using the HttpClient service to consume a web API

> Create a dictionary or **list**, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program

A **List** populated with a retrievable value representing every playable space on the board and used for various dynamic UI elements throughout game play


## API Reference

Future plans for a "high scores" list. For now I've implemented some basic CRUD operations available at `/player` but because the project is deployed to GitHub pages it will require deploying the project on a local machine to test this feature.

#### Get all reservations

```csharp
[HttpGet]
public Task<IActionResult> Get()
in class PlayerController
```

#### Get reservation by "Id"

```csharp
[HttpGet("{id}")]
public Task<IActionResult> Get(int id)
in class PlayerController
```

#### Create reservation

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public Task<IActionResult> Put(Player player)
in class PlayerController
```

#### Edit reservation

```csharp
[HttpPut]
public Task<IActionResult> Put(Player player)
in class PlayerController
```

#### Delete reservation by "Id"

```csharp
[HttpDelete("{id}")]
public Task<IActionResult> Delete(int id)
in class PlayerController
```
